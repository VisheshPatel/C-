### Introduction
- In earlier article we have learned about virtual function. In this article we will learn about virtual class.
- But i am iterating same thing as i have mentioned in earlier article as well. Implementation of a virtual mehcanism is purely compiler dependent, no C++ standard is defined for this. Here i am describing general approach.
- Same as before, before learning anything new we have to see why it needed at first place.
### Why we need a virtual class?

### How virtual class addressing mechanism works
