### Brief
- Here we are going to learn about the type-casting. Although I am not an expert but this what I have learned so far from various sources. So this article is basically a collection of connected dots while I was introducing C++ to myself.
- In C++, there are 5 different types of casts: C-style casts, static casts, const casts, dynamic casts, and reinterpret casts.
- As always we will start with `why we need it?`
