### Introduction
- Before learning All about virtual keyword in C++, i would like to clear two things 
1. Implementation of virtual function is purely compiler dependent, no C++ standard is defined for this.
2. Before learning anything we have to see why it needed at first place.

### Why we need virtual function ?

### How virtual function works

### How & where virtual function & table code synthesize ?

### Virtual function support under multiple inheritance

### How virtual destructor behaviour achieved ?
